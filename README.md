# Blackjack
The project has been developed entirely in Python. The game is simple and contains the basic features of a blackjack game. I have used PyCharm community edition as an IDE to develop it. Source code of the game is contained in the two modules- Game.py (BlackJack/venv/src/Game.py) and BlackjackGUI.py(BlackJack/venv/src/BlackjackGUI.py) The tkinter library in Python is used to create the GUI. The source code can be converted to .exe format using 'py2exe' for windows (http://www.py2exe.org/) and cx_freeze for linux (https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/).

INSTRUCTIONS- If you have python installed, then open the folder 'BlackJack'. Then go to /venv/src/BlackjackGUI.py. Run it using terminal or command prompt or any python IDE (I prefer 'PyCharm'). The tkinter features in the project may differ when running on the terminal or any IDE other than PyCharm. To download PyCharm- https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ .

HOW TO PLAY- A player can interact with the game using keyboard and mouse. Rules of the game are introduced in the game itself. For more information, visit- https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-play-blackjack/ . The interactive buttons make the program control very easy. Players just have to click on the buttons to perform the desired operations. For ex- while a hand is being played, the player has two choices whether to HIT (get another card from the deck) or to STAND (to hold the total and end the turn), the GUI provides the buttons for both moves.
